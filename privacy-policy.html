                <li>Creators can update or delete their AI training data at any time</li>
                <li>Fans can delete their conversation history</li>
                <li>Both creators and fans can request export of their AI-related data</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>AI Limitations</h3>
            <p>Our AI twins are trained to mimic personalities but are not sentient. They may occasionally produce inaccurate or unexpected responses. We continuously monitor and improve AI performance.</p>
